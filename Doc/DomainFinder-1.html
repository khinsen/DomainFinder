<P>DomainFinder is an interactive program for the determination and
characterization of dynamical domains in proteins. A <EM>dynamical
domain</EM> is a region in a protein which can move essentially like a
rigid body relative to other regions. Many, but not all, proteins have
dynamical domains, and if they do, the relative movements of the
domains are usually related to the function of the protein. The
identification of dynamical domains is therefore useful in understanding
the function of the protein. However, there are other situations
in which the knowledge of dynamical domains is helpful. In
structure determination, it can help to predict whether complexation
with a ligand, crystal packing, or other external influences can lead
to important conformational changes. In protein engineering, it can
indicate whether a given modification is likely to change the
dynamical behavior of the protein. In experimental observations of
protein motion, it can suggest regions of particular interest. In
numerical simulations, it can point out the slow motions whose correct
sampling must be verified.
<P>
<P>DomainFinder is based on new theoretical methods which permit the
identification of dynamical domains from a single conformation with
almost negligible computational effort. Any state-of-the-art desktop
computer should be sufficient for analyzing proteins of about 1000
amino acid residues in a few minutes, and even the largest known
protein structures can be analyzed in less than an hour using common
workstations or high-end PCs. DomainFinder can also determine
dynamical domains from a comparison of two given conformations of the
same protein.
<P>
<P>DomainFinder is written in 
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A>, a high-level object programming language that is
particularly well suited to the demands of scientific computations.
The speed-critical parts are implemented in C. For common operations
it makes use of the 
<A HREF="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/MMTK/">Molecular Modeling Toolkit</A>, a library of Python code for
molecular modeling and simulation applications. The results of a
domain analysis can be saved with all details in an MMTK data file,
which permits all kinds of further analysis.
