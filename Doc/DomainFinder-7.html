<P>The goal of a domain analysis is a decomposition of the protein into
regions with distinct dynamical properties. The kinds of regions that
can be distinguished depend on the domain decomposition approach that
is used; in general, the outcome of two domain decompositions using
different approaches will not only be different, but not even directly
comparable. It is thus important to understand the capabilities and
limitations of each approach.
<P>
<P>The techniques implemented in DomainFinder allow an identification
of three types of regions in a protein:
<UL>
<LI> Flexible regions, for which a description of the motion by
rigid bodies is not useful. These regions are recognized
during deformation analysis (see section 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-6.html#deformation">6</A>) and not used at all during domain analysis.</LI>
<LI> Rigid regions with uniform motion. These regions are
recognized as rigid during deformation analysis; domain
analysis then groups them together according to the
similarity of their overall motion. However, these regions
are <EM>not</EM> rigid bodies in any strict sense; they do
show internal deformations, but these deformations do
not destroy the uniformity of the overall motion.
The term ``dynamical domain'' is best interpreted to
describe these rigid regions only.</LI>
<LI> Intermediate regions, whose internal deformation is
sufficiently small everywhere, but systematic enough that
over the size of the region it adds up to produce
sufficiently different overall motion between extremal
parts of the region. Such intermediate regions often
occur in between dynamical domains.</LI>
</UL>

Examples for all three types are shown in Ref. 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-9.html#domain-paper">1</A>.
<P>
<P>The central parameter which allows a distinction between rigid and
intermediate regions is the ``domain coarseness'' parameter.  It
specifies how similar the global motions in a region must be to be
considered similar enough to form a domain (see Ref. 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-9.html#domain-paper">1</A> for details). However, this parameter does not have
one specific ``best'' value which one should find in order to obtain
the ``right'' domain decomposition. It is a parameter which should be
varied, and the ensemble of results for several values of this
parameter provides the information for identifying domains and
intermediate regions.
<P>
<P>In order to obtain the motion parameters necessary for the domain
analysis, DomainFinder first divides the protein into small cubic
regions containing on average six residues. For each cube, six motion
parameters are calculated, three for translation and three for
rotation. In case of a normal mode based analysis, there are six
parameters <EM>per mode</EM>; this is one reason why a normal mode based
analysis usually gives better results. The cubes are then grouped into
domains according to the similarity of their motion parameters.  For a
single value of the domain coarseness, it is not possible to
distinguish between rigid and intermediate regions; the word
``domain'' therefore refers to both type of regions in the program.
<P>
<P>After choosing a value for the domain coarseness, select ``Show
domains'' from the Domains menu. This causes a window to be opened
which shows the domain decomposition for this coarseness level. In the
top left, the protein structure is drawn with various regions
indicated by colors. The list to the right of the structure display
contains all these regions with their color and size. The order in the
list is significant; the best-defined domains are listed first, and
the last item(s) frequently contain cubes that do not really belong to
any recognizable domain. The bottom picture shows a parallel-axis plot
of the motion parameters for all cubes, color-coded by domain. In this
plot, each line represents one cube, and each vertical axis one motion
parameter. For well-defined domains, the lines belonging to the same
domain (i.e. same color) should be very close, whereas lines belonging
to different domains should be clearly separated. A wide band of lines
indicates an intermediate region. The plot provides both a
verification of the domain decomposition and a first impression of the
nature of the domains. However, it should be interpreted with caution;
the eye tends to consider two lines with small differences in all axes
more similar than two lines which coincide in some axes but differ
significantly in others, although from a mathematical point of view
both situations are equivalent.
<P>
<P>It should be noted that the residues shown in black do not belong
to any domain, for one of the following reasons:
<UL>
<LI> they are part of a cube with less than three points, which
is too small to permit the calculation of the motion parameters</LI>
<LI> they are in a cube whose average deformation energy is higher
than the deformation threshold</LI>
</UL>

The precision of the domain definitions is thus not one residue, but
one cube. In practice this is of little importance, because dynamical
domains are by definition big regions, certainly larger than a cube of
six residues on average. However, this effect should be kept in mind,
since it explains some features of the domain analysis that are at
first surprising, e.g. the lack of a perfect symmetry in agreement
with the symmetry of the molecule, or a slight dependence of the
domains on the orientation of the input structures.
<P>
<P>For more detailed information on a particular domain, click on that
domain's entry in the domain list. This will open another window with
information for this domain only. In the top left there is again the
protein structure with just one domain highlighted.  To its right, a
list of all residues in the domain is shown.  Below there is a
parallel-axis plot showing only the cubes in this domain. Finally,
there is an indication of the numerical similarity of the motion
parameters within the domain. Two numerical similarity values are
given, of which the first (larger) one is the similarity of the two
most similar cubes, and the second (smaller) one is the similarity
between this pair and the most different cube. The ratio between these
two number is the domain coarseness which is necessary to consider the
whole region as one domain. The small plot at the bottom shows one
line per cube at the coarseness level required to keep that cube in
the domain. You can use it to estimate the influence of a small change
of coarseness on this domain: if there are many lines close to the
current coarseness limit, the domain is likely to change
significantly. Inversely, if the highest coarseness in the domain is
clearly smaller than the current limit, a small variation will have no
influence on the domain.
<P>
<P>When you vary the domain coarseness limit, you will observe that some
domains remain essentially the same, growing or shrinking only by
small amounts and in response to significant coarseness variations,
whereas others grow and shrink rapidly, or tend to break up into
smaller parts as the coarseness limit is decreased. The first kind
represents stable rigid regions, i.e. dynamical domains. The second
kind represents intermediate regions. The parallel-axis plot at the
bottom of the window helps in this classification by showing the
variation of motion parameters within the domains at one glance.
<P>
<P>Finally, DomainFinder lets you export the domain analysis results for
visualization and further computational analysis by using the
remaining entries in the Domains menu. ``Write domain list...''
writes a complete list of the domains and their residues to a text
file. ``Write PDB file...'' creates a PDB file of the protein
structure with the domain numbers coded in the ``occupancy'' field. A
value of zero indicates a residue outside any domain, other values
refer to the order of the domains in the domain list. ``Write VRML
file...''  provides a VRML version of the color-coded structure in the
domain window. ``Save in MMTK format...'' saves a Python dictionary in
the object format used by the Molecular Modeling Toolkit; this
dictionary contains entries for all variables of interest. The file
can be loaded with the MMTK function <CODE>load()</CODE>.
