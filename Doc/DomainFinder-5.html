<P>After starting DomainFinder, click on the button labeled
``Conformation comparison'' to switch to conformation mode.  You can
switch between modes at any time if you wish to use both modes on the
same protein. Load the reference structure via the File menu entry
``Load reference conformation'', then the second structure via ``Load
comparison conformation''. Note that it does make a difference which
of the two conformations is used as a reference; better results are
obtained if the reference conformation is the one with a larger
exposed surface, i.e. an ``open'' conformation.  Once the two
conformations have been loaded, DomainFinder eliminates global
translational and rotational motion between them, and displays the
remaining RMS difference.
<P>
<P>If you wish to verify that your two conformations are indeed
compatible, you can select ``Show both conformation'' from the File
menu. This will show both conformations together, one in black and one
in red, with the two positions of each atom linked by a blue
line. Erratic blue lines indicate a mismatch between the two
configurations. This display can also serve as a first impression of
the difference between the two conformations.
<P>
<P>Protein structures obtained from experiment are always subject to
experimental inaccuracies. These inaccuracies can distort the
deformation energy calculation, since a random error on each atom
position is indistinguishable from a high overall deformation.
DomainFinder can eliminate such experimental noise while keeping the
important large-scale differences between the conformations; the
details of this procedure have been described in Ref. 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-9.html#domain-paper">1</A>. The amount of noise filtering can be adjusted
using the slider labeled ``Noise filter''. Its value is the amount by
which the RMS distance between the conformations will be reduced by
filtering, given in nm (nanometers). The default value of 0.01 nm is
good for most cases; you should choose a larger value if one or both
conformations have high experimental inaccuracies, as indicated
e.g. by a high crystallographic resolution. A smaller value must be
chosen if the total RMS distance between the conformations is very
small, i.e. smaller than about 0.1 nm. You can verify the effect of
the filter visually using the File menu entry ``Show filter
effect''. It produces a display showing the original comparison
conformation and its filtered equivalent. The reference conformation
is not changed by filtering. The File menu entry ``RMS distances''
shows the three RMS distances between reference, comparison, and
filtered comparison conformations.
<P>
<P>Next you must choose the deformation threshold, i.e. the deformation
energy value that you consider the highest acceptable one for regions
classified as rigid. The default value is a good starting point; you
may have to increase it significantly for small proteins. Note that
the deformation energy definition used by DomainFinder is larger than
the one described in Ref. 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-9.html#domain-paper">1</A> by a factor of five;
this factor was introduced to make typical deformation energies for
conformation-based analysis similar to those for normal mode-based
analysis.
<P>
<P>The following steps are the same as for an analysis based on normal
modes, and are described in sections 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-6.html#deformation">6</A> and 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-7.html#domains">7</A>.
