<P>A detailed description of the theoretical methods used in DomainFinder
can be found in Ref. 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-9.html#domain-paper">1</A>. This
section provides a brief summary that everyone should read before
using DomainFinder.
<P>
<P>Since dynamical domains are by definition large regions in a protein,
DomainFinder does not look at all atoms, but only at the C-alpha
atoms, which define the backbone. Specifically, DomainFinder looks at
<EM>changes</EM> in the relative positions of C-alpha atoms; these changes
describe the deformation of the protein while it undergoes a specific
motion. To characterize the deformation of each part of the protein,
DomainFinder calculates a deformation energy for each atom, which
depends on the changes in the distance of this atom from each of its
close neighbors. A low deformation energy indicates relatively rigid
regions, which are candidates for dynamical domains, whereas high
deformation energies indicate flexible regions. Dynamical domains are
identified by grouping the rigid regions according to their overall
motion; a dynamical domain is thus by definition a sufficiently rigid
region whose parts move in a sufficiently similar way. This procedure
requires two input parameters that the user must provide: a
deformation threshold, up to which a region is considered sufficiently
rigid, and a similarity threshold, up to which the motion of
subregions is considered sufficiently similar.
<P>
<P>In order to analyze protein motions, DomainFinder needs some input
data describing them. One possibility is the use of two different
conformations; the difference between these conformations describes
one possible motion. Typically these conformations are obtained
experimentally (by crystallography or NMR), and differ by the presence
or absence of certain ligands. This mode of operation amounts to an
analysis of experimental data.
<P>
<P>However, there are only few proteins for which two substantially
different conformations are known experimentally. DomainFinder can
also use calculational methods to obtain the necessary information
about domain motions, using only a single conformation as input. The
technique used by DomainFinder is a variant of <EM>normal mode
analysis</EM> which has been optimized for the purpose of domain motion
study. It is described in detail in Ref. 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-9.html#mode-paper">2</A>, the updated form of the interactions used in DomainFinder 2.0 is
described in Ref. 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-9.html#bm-paper">3</A> Even if multiple experimental structures are available, the
normal mode approach is in general preferable, because it yields
clearer domain delimitations and more detail. This is not surprising,
since two conformations necessarily contain only a small subset of the
full protein dynamics.
