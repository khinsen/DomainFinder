<P>Much information about the slow motions of a protein can be obtained
by looking at the deformation energies for each atom. The entry ``Show
deformation'' in the Deformation menu shows the reference conformation
with a color code representing the deformation energies. Blue atoms
correspond to small deformation energies, green atoms are close to the
deformation threshold, and red atoms are in particularly flexible
regions of the protein. Blue and green atoms are thus below the
deformation threshold and candidates for domains in a subsequent
domain analysis; if you find that most of your atoms are yellow or
red, you should increase the deformation threshold before starting the
domain analysis. However, you should also consider the possibility
that your protein has no domains, either because it is too flexible to
allow a description of its slow motions by quasi-rigid substructures,
or because the deformation associated with these motions is uniformly
distributed over the whole protein.
<P>
<P>Although the energy scale for the deformation energies is arbitrary
(see Ref. 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-9.html#domain-paper">1</A> for a detailed discussion), it is
nevertheless an absolute scale independent of the specific
protein. This means that deformation energy values can be compared
between proteins and, in the case of a normal mode based analysis,
between modes. If a certain protein requires a higher deformation
threshold than another protein for a useful domain decomposition, this
indicates that the first protein has a higher overall flexibility and
less rigid domains. A domain decomposition should therefore never be
published without quoting the deformation threshold used for it.
<P>
<P>For a more detailed visualization, the deformation energy information
can be exported in two formats. Using the Deformation menu entry
``Write VRML file...'', you can write a VRML version of DomainFinder's
deformation visualization. With the menu entry ``Write PDB file...''
you can produce a PDB file which contains the deformation energy
values coded in the temperature factor field for each atom.  A
temperature factor of 99 indicates atoms whose deformation energy
exceeds twice the deformation threshold; values between zero and 79.2
correspond linearly to deformation energies between zero and twice the
deformation threshold.
