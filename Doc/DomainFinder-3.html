<P>For a normal-mode-based domain analysis, only a single protein
structure is required, which must be available in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) format. DomainFinder makes an effort to deal with all
common variants of the PDB format, but a correct interpretation is
guaranteed only for files that follow the PDB format definition
exactly, for example files from the Protein Data Bank itself.
The PDB file may contain non-protein molecules (DNA strands,
small molecules, etc.), but DomainFinder will extract only the
peptide chains.
<P>
<P>For a comparison of two conformations, you must have two compatible
conformations, i.e. two PDB files that contain the same residues of a
protein. DomainFinder verifies that the two files contain the same
number of chains, and for each chain the same number of
residues. However, it does not insist that the residue types be equal
(in order to allow a comparison of mutations), and it cannot verify
that corresponding residues in the files actually describe the same
residues in reality. Since many published protein structures are
incomplete, i.e. some residues are missing, you must take care that
the two protein conformations you have are compatible, if necessary by
manually editing the PDB files to remove residues that are in one
conformation but not in the other. DomainFinder provides a visual help
to verify that your conformations are indeed compatible.
