<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Normal mode based analysis</A></H2>

<P>After starting DomainFinder, load your protein structure using ``Load
reference structure...'' in the File menu. DomainFinder will then
propose reasonable values for the number of calculated modes and the
number of modes kept for analysis. However, you may modify these
numbers if you wish. The number of calculated modes determines the
accuracy of the normal mode calculations; the more modes you
calculate, the better the description of the motions. The value
proposed by DomainFinder is a rather small, but reasonable, value; you
might want to increase it to obtain better results. In contrast, the
number of modes kept for analysis has no influence on the quality of
the results. It exists purely for efficiency reasons: keeping all
calculated modes would slow down the analysis and waste disk space if
the modes are saved in a file. There is little reason to increase the
proposed number, because the additional modes typically do not
describe domain motions are are therefore not useful for the domain
analysis.
<P>
<P>To start the normal mode calculation, press the button labeled
``Calculate modes''. Depending on the size of the protein and the
speed of your computer, the calculation can take from a few seconds to
a few hours. For example, the calculation of 100 modes for a
500-residue protein takes 90 seconds on a 90 MHz Pentium PC; the same
calculation takes 22 seconds on an IBM RS/6000 Model 43P-140. When the
calculation is finished, DomainFinder displays a list of the modes
with non-zero frequencies (the first number is seven, because there
are six zero-frequency modes) and the actual number of calculated
modes. This number is in general different from the one you entered,
because not all values are possible for technical reasons (see the
discussion on Fourier bases in Ref. 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-9.html#mode-paper">2</A>). If the
number of modes you ask for is equal to or larger than the number of
residues in the protein, DomainFinder will calculate all possible
modes (three times the number of residues), because calculating fewer
modes would not be more efficient.
<P>
<P>You must now select the modes that you want to use for the deformation
and domain analysis. To help you with this choice, the normal mode
list indicates the average deformation energy per residue for each
mode. As explained in 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-2.html#theory">section 2</A>, a
deformation energy is associated with every atom; low values
characterize rigid regions, whereas high values indicate flexible
regions. A low average deformation energy thus indicates a mode with
large rigid regions, which has a good chance of describing domain
motions. There is no simple recipe for selecting an optimal set of
modes (otherwise DomainFinder would apply it automatically!). As a
general guideline, look for jumps in the average deformation energy
from one mode to the next, and choose all modes before such a jump;
there is no justification for selecting only some out of a set of
modes with very similar deformation energies. Start with few modes,
and add more modes only if you are not satisfied with the amount of
detail in the domain analysis.
<P>
<P>After selecting the modes, you must choose the deformation threshold
that defines which regions are sufficiently rigid to be candidates for
domains. This choice is related to the mode selection; to have a
reasonable number of rigid regions, the deformation threshold should
be of the same order of magnitude as the average deformation energy of
the modes you have chosen. A higher deformation threshold leads to
larger rigid regions; if you find later that your domains cover too
small a part of the protein, you should increase the deformation
threshold.
<P>
<P>The following steps are the same as for an analysis based
on comparing two conformations, and are described in sections
<A HREF="DomainFinder-6.html#deformation">6</A> and 
<A HREF="DomainFinder-7.html#domains">7</A>.
<P>
<P>If you wish to stop working on an analysis and continue it later,
you can save time by saving the already calculated normal modes
to a file and then later loading this file instead of the input
structure. This is done using the File menu entries ``Save modes...''
and ``Load modes...''.
