Description: DomainFinder is an interactive program for the determination and
        characterization of dynamical domains in proteins. Its key features
        are
        
        - computational efficiency: even large proteins can be analyzed
        using a desktop computer in a few minutes
        
        - ease of use: a state-of-the-art graphical user interface
        
        - export of results for visualization and further analysis
        (VRML, PDB, and MMTK object format)
