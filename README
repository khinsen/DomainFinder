This is version 2.0.4 of DomainFinder, an interactive program for the
determination and characterization of dynamical domains in proteins.
This program is copyrighted but free to use for anyone under the
CeCILL-C License, see the file LICENSE for details.

DomainFinder should work with all major variants of Unix. There is no
system-specific code in DomainFinder itself, so porting DomainFinder
to non-Unix systems should be easy. However, I cannot provide
any support for this.

If you have any questions about DomainFinder that are not answered
on the Web page mentioned above, please contact the author.

Installation
============

DomainFinder requires the Python interpreter (version 2.3 or higher)
with the Tk interface installed, and the Molecular Modeling Toolkit
(MMTK), version 2.4 or higher. Make sure that these components work
properly before installing DomainFinder. The MMTK example scripts
should work, as well as the Tkinter Demo programs from the Python
distribution.

Then type

    python setup.py install

On most systems this will require root permissions, as by default
the files will be installed in the same directory as the Python
interpreter. Other directories can be specified, type

    python setup.py --help install

for explanations. Once installation is finished, type

    DomainFinder

to run the program.

When dealing with very large proteins, it can be of interest to
perform the normal mode calculation on a faster machine or on a
machine with more memory than the workstation used for visualization.
Sometimes computers dedicated to number crunching applications do
not provide a graphical user interface, and then the DomainFinder
program cannot be run.

A seperate program called DomainFinderModes is therefore provided
to calculate the normal modes and save them to a file, which can
then be transferred to the workstation and analyzed with DomainFinder.
To execute this program, type

   DomainFinderModes pdb-file mode-file modes-saved modes-calculated

The first argument is the PDB file from which the protein conformation
is read. The second argument is the name of the mode file to be
created. The third argument indicates how many modes should be kept
in the file, and the fourth argument specifies the number of modes
to be calculated. See the DomainFinder manual for a discussion of
the meaning of these parameters.


Documentation
=============

The directory Doc contains the DomainFinder manual in two formats:
HTML and SGML/Linuxdoc.


Visualization examples
======================

While the graphics displays in DomainFinder are sufficient for
interactive analysis, it is often desirable to produce high-quality
images for publications and presentations. These can be produced by
saving modes and/or domains (in MMTK format) and using appropriate
Python scripts (using MMTK) for visualization.

Two example scripts can be found in the directory Visualization. The
script vector_field.py visualizes atomic displacements in a given
normal mode by arrows placed on a grid. The script visualization.py
shows the domains by colors and their movements in a given mode by a
scre-motion axis and an arrow. Both scripts require the molecule
viewer VMD, which is available from http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/.
Using the rendering functions of VMD plus ray-tracing programs, very
high quality pictures can be produced.
